BlackJack

Run the project from your IDE, game is entirely in the CLI

 - Soft max of 4 players (this excludes the Dealer)
 - Most user input is guarded, but not all, so try to play by the tooltip rules
 - Most action will be automatic after input, with 3-5 second delays for certain actions
 - The current game message/action is at the very bottom of the CLI
 - Game will play until all players have left the game or have gone bankrupt

Please create issues for bug finds
